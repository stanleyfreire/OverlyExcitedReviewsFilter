# OverlyExcitedReviewsFilter

This solution solves the problem where overly excited reviews are being published on DealerRater.com website and they need some way to filter the ones that stand out the most.  

To achieve the results this solution consist in two main projects:  
    -   ReviewScrapperAPI - API responsible for fetching data from DealerRater.com  
    -   ReviewScrapper - Service responsible for filtering reviews given "excitment criteria" (listed below).

## ReviewScrapperAPI

This API uses HtmlAgilityPack and System.Net.Http libraries to fetch data from DealerRater.com. 

// talk about how it works and how it scraps data from the website.  
// show how to call this API if needed - GET Request  
// show how the API returns data to the client - GET Response  
// maybe show Swagger or link it?  

// talk about Unit Tests and what was tested here.  

## ReviewScrapper

This service is responsible for getting data back from ReviewScrapperAPI, filtering the reviews and displaying them on a Console.  
To filter the reviews the service uses what I like to call an "Excitment Criteria" and a Regex pattern.  

### The "Excitment Criteria"

In order to filter the reviews, the software needs to look for positive adjectives in English - main language that the McKaig Chevrolet Buick dealership customers use - like "Great", "Awesome", "Terrific", "Wonderful" or even sentences like "Best place in the world" that are listed below:


    1. Simple adjectives - weight 1:
    1.1. Awesome, Terrific, Best, Charming, Cute, Delightful, Excited, Exuberant, Excellent, Fancy, Fantastic, Fine, glamorous, Good, Happy, Happier, Helpful, Great, Magnificent, Nice, Pleasant, Perfect, Splendid, Super, Superb, Wonderful.
    
    2. Sentences - weigth 2:
    2.1. Best place in the world, Best dealership, Perfect Dealership, Awesome Experience, Above and Beyond, Absolutely the Best, Will Visit Again, Should Visit Again, Must Stop, Wonderful Experience, Great Experience.


Does that mean that a review that looks like this: "I was very well treated inside the dealership and had a wonderful experience!" should be voted down just because it contains the word "wonderful" inside it?  
No! That's when the "Excitment Score" comes in play.

### The "Excitment Score"

The Excitment Score consists in 2 sub-scores:  
- UserScore
    - How many reviews the same User published? The same user left a review inside a little time frame for the same dealership? Kinda odd. Each review count as 1 point here. Lower value is better.
- WordScore
    - How excited was his(her) writing? This score depends on how **many** matches were found inside the Review Text and the **weight** of each match. Lower is better.  

The ReviewScrapper service will iterate through all reviews and score them as Normal, Excited and Overly Excited using the criteria below:  

Review Total Score:  
1-3: Normal  
4-6: Excited  
7> :  Overly Excited 

The algorithm will run 2 times: first searching for sentences then searching for words. 

- How the algorithm will know that?
- Whenever a match occurs inside the review text, I'll add some points to this review, so for example:
Using the list above, if I have the review text as: "Today I had a **great experience**! So **awesome** to be inside the dealership!" the words score would be 3 (1 word         had a match: "awesome" and 1 sentence had a match too: "great experience"). That count as Normal.

- Now for another review that the text looks like this: "The **perfect dealership** in Texas. **Best place in the world**. **Fantastic**!" the score would be 5. Why 5? Because **perfect dealership** and **Best place in the world** have a weight of 2 but the word **Fantastic** has a weight of 1. Summing it all you got 5. That count as Excited.
- Note: even though the word Best was found inside the sentence "Best place in the world" I'll only score 2 points for it. Sentences have priority over words.

// maybe? ....  
I'll save the ocurrences count on each word/sentence for later use. It'll help me decrease the score of some of the most used words.




- Explicar qual problema quero solucionar.

- Explicar como cheguei na solução do problema e explicar os três passos:
	 (explicar arquitetura com injeção de dependência e pq 
	 (pra modularizar a aplicação e testar cada método com mais facilidade unitariamente)
	- INPUT: 
		Falar do scrapping usando HttlAgilityPack
	- PROCESS: 
		*Falar que duplicatas são removidas neste passo
		*Falar como são processado os reviews.
		*Falar sobre o arquivo expressions.json e do scores.json
		*Falar da possibilidade de expandir o código/alterá-lo apenas ao alterar os configs/expressions.
		*Adicionar Criteria aqui
		 (Word: 1 ponto | Sentence: 2 pontos | Qualquer Exclamaçao: 1 ponto | Cada recorrência na UserList: 1 ponto | Palavra contida em sentença: Metade da Pontuação )
	- OUTPUT: 
		Comentar sobre criterio de desempate aqui
		Exemplo de output do Console.

- Explicar ideias que desisti no meio do caminho, como a API
- Explicar ideias que tive mas não implementei (como Azure Analytics)
- Explicar testes unitários.
	- Interessante dizer que os testes podem ser infinitos.
	- Inserir lista de testes unitários e breve descrição do que fazem.
- Explicar como executar em Windows e em MacOS.
